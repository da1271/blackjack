**Description**: Black jack will be a user friendly game where
    people can practice "hit" and "stay". The game will initiate with a 
    simple black jack table background with a deck of card on the side, and with
    4 boxes (two slot for user and two slot for dearler). The card will be 
    distributed between the dealer/user and the user will have two options
    of "hit" or "stay". If hit/stay is clicked, an additional card will be dealt/
    not dealt to the user and the black jack rule will be used for programming
    with javascript.
